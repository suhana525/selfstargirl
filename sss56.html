    *Do not whine…Do not complain. Work harder. Spend more time alone.”<br></br>
    *Let us make our future now, and let us make our dreams tomorrow’s reality.”<br></br>
    *The three great essentials to achieve anything worthwhile are Hard work, stick-to-itiveness, and common sense.”<br></br>
    *“If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost; that is where they should be. Now put the foundations under them.”<br></br>
    *Doing the best at this moment puts you in the best place for the next moment.” <br></br>
    *To achieve your dreams, work is required. Suffering is optional.”<br></br>
    *The only way to achieve the impossible is to believe it is possible.”<br></br>
    *There is no magic to achievement. It’s really about hard work, choices, and persistence.”<br></br>
    *In any given moment we have two options. To step forward into growth or to step back into safety.” <br></br>
    *Do what you have to do until you can do what you want to do.”<br></br>

    <h2>Puts her family first</h2>
<h3>If you are thinking of what to look for in a wife, know that a good wife puts her family first. 
The family’s needs and wants top her priorities, and she’s not apologetic about it. A good wife goes the extra mile to ensure her home is comfortable for her husband and kids</h3>
<h2>Husband’s best friend and lover</h2>
<h3>A good wife does not cheat because her husband is her one and only lover. 
In addition, she could have close friends, but her husband remains her best friend. If there are any pending issues, she talks first to her husband, who doubles as her best friend.</h3>
<h2>A good problem-solver</h2>
<h3>In marriage, one of the qualities of a good wife to look for is her willingness and ability to tackle problems. 
A good wife neither leaves all the problems to her husband to solve nor points accusing fingers at anyone. Instead, she works together with her husband to combat these problems.</h3>
<h2>Treasures teamwork</h2>
<h3>What makes a good wife is her ability to collaborate and participate as an active team player. She does not leave her husband to tackle any issue alone. 
Rather, she contributes her quota, and she acknowledges her husband’s effort. A good wife knows that collaborative efforts keep the marriage intact as everything goes smoothly.</h3>
<h2>Celebrates her husband’s achievement</h2>
<h3>One of the attributes of a good woman is that she doesn’t see her husband’s achievement as a means to compete. Rather, she appreciates him and acknowledges his efforts.
If there are children, she seizes the opportunity to use her husband’s success to motivate them.</h3>
<h2> She is honest</h2>
<h3>A man can only trust his wife when she has proven to be honest countless times. 
Lasting marriages are built on honesty and effective communication. There’s a twist to being honest; you don’t have to say anything plainly. For instance, if you don’t like his shoes, you can replace them by getting new pairs.</h3>

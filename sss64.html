    <h2>What does it mean to be a good wife?</h2>
<h3>*One of the reasons why a woman is tagged a good wife is because of her readiness to make the marriage work. When the couple disagrees, a good wife would follow the lead of her husband and be receptive to resolving issues amicably.
Also, a good wife understands her husband cannot be perfect, so she does not struggle to mold him into her perfect model. Rather, she adjusts to his personality and corrects his shortcomings when he errs.
A good wife displays qualities that not only help build a home and family but also helps her project herself as a good human being.</h3>
<h2>Caring and compassionate</h2> 
<h3>A good wife exhibits both care and compassion. She is sensitive to the family’s needs, and does her best to provide a solution. She understands when her husband is frustrated, and tries to make him happy.
Her caring disposition makes sure the family does not lack in any aspect of life.</h3>
<h2>Sensitive of the little things</h2>
<h3>A good wife is not oblivious to the little things that happen in the home. 
For instance, if the husband does something considered to be small, she does not ignore it. Rather, she warms up lovingly and appreciates him. On the other hand, if the husband is sad about something in the home, she tries her best to fix it.

No matter how busy the good wife’s schedule is, she makes time to spend with her husband.</h3>
<h2> Spends quality time with her husband</h2>
<h3>Some women don’t spend time with their husbands using excuses like an extremely busy schedule. A good wife understands that the quality time spent maintains the spark in the marriage</h3>
<h2>Encourages her husband</h2>
<h3>One important role of a wife in a man’s life is acting as a source of encouragement and support. 
In both good and bad times, one of the qualities of a good wife is to encourage and show her husband that he is loved. When men experience challenging times, they don’t see their value. 
However, a good wife reminds them of the great worth they possess.</h3>
<h2>Respects her husband</h2>
<h3>A successful marriage thrives on respect. If you are searching for the characteristics of a good wife, make sure she is respectful. 
In addition, a good wife appreciates her husband’s effort, and the husband reciprocates with respect and love.</h3>

    <h2>What does it mean to be a good wife?</h2>
<h3>*One of the reasons why a woman is tagged a good wife is because of her readiness to make the marriage work. When the couple disagrees, a good wife would follow the lead of her husband and be receptive to resolving issues amicably.
Also, a good wife understands her husband cannot be perfect, so she does not struggle to mold him into her perfect model. Rather, she adjusts to his personality and corrects his shortcomings when he errs.
A good wife displays qualities that not only help build a home and family but also helps her project herself as a good human being.</h3>
<h2>Caring and compassionate</h2> 
<h3>A good wife exhibits both care and compassion. She is sensitive to the family’s needs, and does her best to provide a solution. She understands when her husband is frustrated, and tries to make him happy.
Her caring disposition makes sure the family does not lack in any aspect of life.</h3>
<h2>Sensitive of the little things</h2>
<h3>A good wife is not oblivious to the little things that happen in the home. 
For instance, if the husband does something considered to be small, she does not ignore it. Rather, she warms up lovingly and appreciates him. On the other hand, if the husband is sad about something in the home, she tries her best to fix it.

No matter how busy the good wife’s schedule is, she makes time to spend with her husband.</h3>
<h2> Spends quality time with her husband</h2>
<h3>Some women don’t spend time with their husbands using excuses like an extremely busy schedule. A good wife understands that the quality time spent maintains the spark in the marriage</h3>
<h2>Encourages her husband</h2>
<h3>One important role of a wife in a man’s life is acting as a source of encouragement and support. 
In both good and bad times, one of the qualities of a good wife is to encourage and show her husband that he is loved. When men experience challenging times, they don’t see their value. 
However, a good wife reminds them of the great worth they possess.</h3>
<h2>Respects her husband</h2>
<h3>A successful marriage thrives on respect. If you are searching for the characteristics of a good wife, make sure she is respectful. 
In addition, a good wife appreciates her husband’s effort, and the husband reciprocates with respect and love.</h3>

    <h2>Puts her family first</h2>
<h3>If you are thinking of what to look for in a wife, know that a good wife puts her family first. 
The family’s needs and wants top her priorities, and she’s not apologetic about it. A good wife goes the extra mile to ensure her home is comfortable for her husband and kids</h3>
<h2>Husband’s best friend and lover</h2>
<h3>A good wife does not cheat because her husband is her one and only lover. 
In addition, she could have close friends, but her husband remains her best friend. If there are any pending issues, she talks first to her husband, who doubles as her best friend.</h3>
<h2>A good problem-solver</h2>
<h3>In marriage, one of the qualities of a good wife to look for is her willingness and ability to tackle problems. 
A good wife neither leaves all the problems to her husband to solve nor points accusing fingers at anyone. Instead, she works together with her husband to combat these problems.</h3>
<h2>Treasures teamwork</h2>
<h3>What makes a good wife is her ability to collaborate and participate as an active team player. She does not leave her husband to tackle any issue alone. 
Rather, she contributes her quota, and she acknowledges her husband’s effort. A good wife knows that collaborative efforts keep the marriage intact as everything goes smoothly.</h3>
<h2>Celebrates her husband’s achievement</h2>
<h3>One of the attributes of a good woman is that she doesn’t see her husband’s achievement as a means to compete. Rather, she appreciates him and acknowledges his efforts.
If there are children, she seizes the opportunity to use her husband’s success to motivate them.</h3>
<h2> She is honest</h2>
<h3>A man can only trust his wife when she has proven to be honest countless times. 
Lasting marriages are built on honesty and effective communication. There’s a twist to being honest; you don’t have to say anything plainly. For instance, if you don’t like his shoes, you can replace them by getting new pairs.</h3>
